# Build Multiply Linear Regression Model
---
## Overview
---
This project aims to predict student performance based on their study hours using a Multiply Linear Regression model.

---
## Objectives
---
* Perform data scaling  
* Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
* Build a Multiply Linear Regression model  
* Provide insights based on the results  

---
## Dataset
---
The dataset contains 5 features and 1 target variable:

* hours_studied                       
* previous_scores                    
* extracurricular_activities          
* sleep_hours                         
* sample_question_papers_practiced  
* performance_index (target)
